# Training-Projects
Welcome to my repository, where you'll find a collection of my training projects involving MySQL, Power BI, and Excel.

This repository reflects my learning journey, and with that, you'll notice all kinds of mistakes:

- Code and design errors
- Logical missteps
- Misinterpretations, and more
Despite these, I'm proud of the progress these projects represent. They were my starting point, and I believe growth comes through trial and error. ðŸ˜Š
